#  Script which will remove bad events  #
#    - Uncomplete events                #
#    - Zero-weight events               #
#  Required inputs are:                 #
#    - whichDir                         #
#                                       #
#  --> If no events have to be removed, #
#      the new weights_xx.out file will #
#      be deleted to avoid overload     #
#                                       #
#  *Files which need to be accessed:    #
#    1) Original weights.out file       #
#    2) output.xml for #evts & configs  #
#                                       #
#  !Add option to perform both removes  #
#   separately (as was the case before  #
#   with two separate files)            #
#                                       #
